# cloud-based-face-recognition-system

In this project, I designed and implemented a cloud-based face recognition system using AWS services. I used *Amazon Rekognition* for face detection and recognition, *S3* for storing images securely, *Lambda* for serverless computation, and *DynamoDB* to manage and query metadata.  

The system was developed to perform real-time face matching with a scalable and secure architecture, demonstrating the potential for applications like attendance systems and access control. While testing was not conducted, the system's design highlights its effectiveness in providing a reliable framework for face recognition tasks.
